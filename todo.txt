/* TODO:
1-) username only accepts pure strings;
does accept empty string => shouldnt
does not accept strings like test5 => should
2-) getAllUsers try catch clean
3-) usernotfound visible when front page is first opened
4-) react memo?
5-) graphql fetch on usersdemo is not used everyhere => func name change?
6-) comments
7-) unit tests
8-) everything async?
9-) userservice 
  TODO: You may want to introduce custom error classes 
  (e.g. UserNotFoundError) and map them to GraphQL errors later.
10-)deleteUser case where id doesnt belong to anyone
11-)move deleteUser logic from service to resolver
12-)add user if user exists and user says dont force, it wont go to resolver => no need for force: boolean | undefined, 
can do force:boolean with default false
resolver only needs to handle a)user doesnt exists 
                              b)user exists, force false(covers both, hasnt asked user if he wants to force + no force because client wont say anyting to resolver if force false)
                              c)user exists, force true
