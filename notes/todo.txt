/* TODO:
3-) may want to introduce custom error classes - e.g. UserNotFoundError) and map them to GraphQL errors later.
5-) make a global db access module(@Global()  -https://docs.nestjs.com/modules) 
9-) Use try/catch only for meaningful error conversion
14-) get all cases when db is empty
15-) extract query strings for readability
16-) logged in user gets deleted, feed says user not found
17-) postItem isowner and canfollow checks are sloppy
18-) currentUserId is passed around in client. its unneccesary. centralize auth and identity
19-) make sure you check which profile tabs refresh on page refresh vs tab change
20-) resolver async
21-) follow service  async getFollowersWithFollowStat is there a better way than to return user and raw arrays
22-) user profile activity follow activity shows follow button that is inaccurate and does nothing
